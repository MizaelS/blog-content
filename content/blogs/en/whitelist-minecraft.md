# How to Use the Whitelist in Minecraft: Complete Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction to Minecraft Whitelist

Minecraft's whitelist feature is a server-side access control system that ensures only approved players can join a server. It is widely used by server administrators to protect their worlds from unauthorized access, griefing, or trolling.

* Helps manage a private community

## Benefits of Using a Whitelist

Whitelist reduces the chances of intrusions and malicious players.
